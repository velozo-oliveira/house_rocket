## 1 - Description
**House Rocket** is a fictional company looking for investment opportunities in the real estate market.

The purpose of this project is to create insights through data analysis to help the decision-makers find the best business opportunities in the real estate market of King County. In other words, finding homes below market value in good locations and with good potential for future resale at a higher price.

## 2 - Business Problem
The House Rocket CEO set the following business problems:

* What properties should we purchase and at what price?
* After the properties are in the company's possession, what is the best time to sell them and what would the sale prices be?
* Should House Rocket do a renovation to raise the sale price? What would be the suggestions for changes? What is the price increase given for each refurbishment option?

## 3 - Data Overview
The dataset used in this project represents properties sold from May 2014 through May 2015 in King County, WA - USA. 
The dataset is available on [Kaggle - House Sales in King County, USA.](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)

## 4. Business Assumptions
The assumptions of the business problem in this project are as follow:

* All the properties are considered options to be purchased by House Rocket Company for the **price** listed in the dataset.
* The duplicate **ID** values were removed and only considered the most recent buy.
* Values of 0 in attribute **yr_renovated** are buildings that were not renovated.
* The **location** and **condition** of the property is key for the decision on whether to buy it or not.
* The **season** is the decisive variable for the selling of the properties.

## 5. Solution Strategy

### Step 1. Business Analysis and Data Collection
* Understand the business problem
* Collect Data from Kaggle

### Step 2. Data Transformation:
* Variable transformation
* Data cleaning

### Step 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
* Explore the data to find insights for the business team
* Build, deploy and run a cloud application where the House Rocket CEO can do the analyses by himself reviewing the company's portfolio. 

The app presents descriptive tables, graphs and maps with an interactive user interface. With the available filters, the CEO can select the data to be shown in tables and graphs.

### Step 4. Hypotheses Testing
* Discover insights and trends and communicate the findings to the business team.

### Step 5. Business Solutions
* Purchase Recommendation Report 

Group the homes by area (zip code). Calculate the median price within each area. Include in the report homes that are below the median price for each area and that are in good condition. The report can be found here: [Link]

* Sales Price Report

Create a report listing all properties with a recommended sales price for each one. Group the homes by area (zip code) and by seasons (summer, winter, and so on). Calculate the median price within each area and season. The report can be found here: [Link]

### Step 6. Conclusions

## 6. Hypothesis Testing

*Hypothesis 01*: Properties that are waterfront are, in average, 30% more expensive.  
**False**: Waterfront houses are 213% more expensive, on average.

*Hypothesis 02*: Properties built before 1955 are, in average, 15% less expensive.

**False**: Properties built before 1955 are 1.0 % cheaper than properties built after 1955. The year built does not influence the price of the property.

*Hypothesis 03*: Properties with basement have a living area 20% bigger than the ones without basement.

**True**: Properties with basement are approximately 20% bigger in terms of living area, compared with properties without basement.

*Hypothesis 04*: Properties that were never renovated are, in average, 20% less expensive.

**False**: Properties that were never renovated are, in average, 43 % less expensive

*Hypothesis 05*: Properties with higher number of bedrooms are, in average, 10% more expensive.

**False**: Properties with 7 to 9 bedrooms are, in avarage, more expensive.

*Hypothesis 06*: The MoM (Month over Month) growth of the price of the properties with 3 bathrooms is 15%.

**False**: The average price of the properties is higher between March and July.

## 8. Next Steps

Include more variables in the purchasing analyis, such as number of badrooms, living area, etc.
